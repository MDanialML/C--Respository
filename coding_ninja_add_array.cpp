// Problem statement
// You are given two numbers 'A' and 'B' in the form of 
// two arrays (A[] and B[]) of lengths 'N' and 'M' respectively,
//  where each array element represents a digit. 
// You need to find the sum of these two numbers and return this sum in the form of an array.

// Note:

// 1. The length of each array is greater than zero.

// 2. The first index of each array is the most significant digit of the number.
//  For example, if the array A[] = {4, 5, 1}, 
// then the integer represented by this array is 451 and array B[] = {3, 4, 5} so
// the sum will be 451 + 345 = 796.
//  So you need to return {7, 9, 6}.

// 3. Both numbers do not have any leading zeros in them. And subsequently, 
// the sum should not contain any leading zeros.
